## How to contribute
Everyone is invited and welcome to contribute to AccessD. There's a lot to do — if you're not a developer we can always use help with the official [project documentation](https://docs.accessd.com) and language [translations](https://crowdin.com/project/accessd). If you have experience in Linux networking, you can share your knowledge by answering questions from AccessD users in our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/AccessD/accessd-webui/discussions) and/or the [/r/AccessD](https://reddit.com/r/AccessD) subreddit.

If you're a devloper, the process of contributing code is straightforward:

1. Fork the project in your account and create a new branch: `feat/your-feature` or `fix/your-bugfix`.
2. Open [an issue](https://github.com/AccessD/accessd-webui/issues) describing the feature or bug fix contribution you'd like to make.
3. Commit changes in your branch.
4. Open a pull request and reference the initial issue in the pull request message, or by linking it in GitHub.

### Coding standards
This project follows the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding style guidelines. There are many ways to check your code for PSR-2. An excellent tool is [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer). The command line tool phpcs can be run against any single file. [Phing](https://www.phing.info/), a PHP build tool, integrates nicely with `phpcs` to automate PSR-2 checks across all source files in a project.
